# Project Base for Vaadin Flow and Spring Boot / String Alignment Exercise

In case both input TextFields have spaces, the solution will use words(solutionWord) and do the comparison based on which words have been kept. 
Otherwise, the method solutionChar will be used, and comparison will be done on each  character. 

As explained in exercise requirements, the cleaning method is not taken into consideration. Purpose is to dispkay which characters/words have been kept from the original to reach the cleaned text. Cleaning method is arbitrary.
